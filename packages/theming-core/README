# [Office UI Fabric React ThemingCore](http://dev.microsoft.com/fabric)

##### ThemingCore components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and __should never be used in product__. This ThemingCore space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import ThemingCore components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/theming-core';
```

Once the ThemingCore component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
